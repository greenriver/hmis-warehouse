## Introduction

The HMIS Warehouse project was initiated by the City of Boston's Department of Neighborhood Development to gather data from across various HMIS installations, produce aggregated reports, and supply de-duplicated client information to the [Boston CAS](https://github.com/greenriver/boston-cas) system for Coordinated Access to housing.

At its core the Warehouse ingests standard HUD HMIS CSV files, de duplicates clients across HMIS data sources, and aggregates data associated with HMIS clients from additional sources.

## Vision

The City of Boston made a conscientious choice to release this project into the open source under a GPL. Our goal is to promote this opportunity, allowing Boston's investment to assist other municipalities and organizations, and realize the vision of a tool under continuous, collaborative improvement helping communities nationwide.

Looking ahead, we see the Warehouse codebase serving as a foundation for all communities that report to the department of Housing and Urban Development, or have a need to aggregate and de-duplicate homeless client data from across various systems.

## Application Design

The application is designed around the [HUD Data Standards](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hmis/hmis-data-and-technical-standards/) and the data structure is based on the [HMIS Logical Model](https://github.com/hmis-interop/logical-model)

The application is written primarily in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org), and uses [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) for data storage.

## Other Open Path Applications
Open Path is a suite of open-source HMIS related applications and includes:
- Open Path Warehouse, found in this repository
- [Open Path HMIS](http://github.com/greenriver/hmis-frontend), a service provider front-end HMIS tightly integrated with the warehouse
- [Open Path CAS](https://github.com/greenriver/boston-cas), a coordinated entry workflow tool for streamlining access to limited housing and other resources.
