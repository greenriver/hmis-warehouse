# Open Path HMIS Warehouse [![Actions Status](https://github.com/greenriver/hmis-warehouse/workflows/Audit%20and%20Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/greenriver/hmis-warehouse/actions)

## Introduction

The HMIS Warehouse project was initiated by the City of Boston's Department of Neighborhood Development to gather data from across various HMIS installations, produce aggregated reports, and supply de-duplicated client information to the [Boston CAS](https://github.com/greenriver/boston-cas) system for Coordinated Access to housing.

The Warehouse is capable of ingesting standard HUD HMIS CSV files as well as data via the Social Solutions ETO API.

## Vision

The City of Boston made a conscientious choice to release this project into the open source under a GPL. Our goal is to promote this opportunity, allowing Boston's investment to assist other municipalities and organizations, and realize the vision of a tool under continuous, collaborative improvement helping communities nationwide.

Looking ahead, we see the Warehouse codebase serving as a foundation for all communities that report to the department of Housing and Urban Development, or have a need to aggregate and de-duplicate homeless client data from across various systems.  To our knowledge, this is the only open source, freely available implementation of many HUD reports.

## Application Design

The application is designed around the [HUD Data Standards](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hmis/hmis-data-and-technical-standards/) and the data structure is based on the [HMIS Logical Model](http://www.hudhdx.info/VendorResources.aspx)

The application is written primarily in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) and we use [RVM](https://rvm.io/) to select a ruby version. Other ruby version managers should work fine, as would manually installing the ruby version mentioned in the `.ruby-version`

The application uses [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) for application data storage and [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/) or postgres for the warehouse data.

We've developed locally on OSX using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and deployed to Ubuntu 16.04 using `apt` for dependencies.

### Developer Prerequisites

If you are unfamiliar with contributing to open source projects on Github you may first want to read some of the guides at:  https://guides.github.com/

There is a simple script to setup a development environment in `bin/setup`. To make it run smoothly you should have:

* A running Ruby 2.3+ environment with bundler 1.11+ installed.
* A local install of postgresql 9.5+ allowing your user to create new databases.
* A local install of redis for caching. redis-server should be running on the default port
* libmagic (`brew install libmagic`)
* freetds (`brew install freetds`)

Once these are in place, `bin/setup` should:

* Install all ruby dependencies.
* Create initial copies of configuration files.
* Create an initial database and seed it with reference data and a randomly generated admin user.

If all goes well you should then be able to run `bin/rails server` and open the Warehouse in your system at http://localhost:3000 using the email/password created during `bin/setup`. If not, read `bin/setup` to figure out what went wrong and fix it.

Hack on your version as you see fit and if you have questions or want to contribute open an issue on github.

# Developer Notes

We use the following common rails gems and conventions:

* `haml` for view templating
* `bootstrap` for base styles and layout
* `sass` for custom-css
* `simple_form` for forms
* `pagy` for pagination
* `brakeman` for basic security scanning.
* `rack-mini-profiler` to make sure pages are fast. Ideally <200ms
* helpers need to be explictly loaded in controllers. i.e. we have `config.action_controller.include_all_helpers = false` set
* `bin/rake generate controller ... ` doesn't make fixures and they are disabled in test_helper. We don't use them and instead seed data in test or let test create their own data however they need to.
* it also doesn't make helper or asset stubs, make them by hand if you need one. See `config/application.rb` for details.

# Multiple databases

The project reads/writes from several different databases. We keep track of these different environments by setting up parallel db configs and structures for each database. Health care data is configured in config/database_health.yml and database resources are in db/health. Warehouse data is configured in config/database_warehouse.yml and resources are in db/warehouse. When running migrations, use the custom generators.

App migrations can be created with:

```
rails generate migration foo
```
and run with
```
rake db:migrate
```
Warehouse migrations can be created with:
```
rails generate warehouse_migration foo
```
and run with
```
rake warehouse:db:migrate
```

Health migrations can be created with

```
rails generate health_migration foo
```
and run with
```
rake health:db:migrate
```

# HMIS CSV-Structured Tables

Several tables in the warehouse database are modeled after [HMIS CSV Format Specifications (2024 link)](https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/HMIS-CSV-Format-Specifications-2024.pdf). These tables can be identified by their casing, which matches the CSV Spec. For example `Enrollment`, `Client`, `ProjectCoC`, etc.

The HMIS CSV-Structured tables share some common attributes:
* `data_source_id`: identifies which Data Source the HMIS data came from
* `EnrollmentID`: HUD Key referencing Enrollment table
* `PersonalID`: HUD Key referencing Client table
* `ProjectID`: HUD Key referencing Project table
* `UserID`: HUD Key referencing User table

These "HUD Keys" are used to link HMIS records together. We always use [composite keys](https://github.com/greenriver/hmis-warehouse/blob/ca8a5ac066f671acfec417a22102eadbbff4bd7b/drivers/hmis/app/models/hmis/hud/base.rb#L32-L69) for relationships between HMIS CSV tables. This is necessary because HUD Keys are **not unique across data sources.**

### FAQs

#### What's the difference between `Enrollment.id` and `Enrollment.enrollment_id`?

* `Enrollment.id` is that database ID for the enrollment. It is unique in the Enrollment table. It is an incrementing numeric id that is generated by the database.
* `Enrollment.enrollment_id` is the `EnrollmentID` column on the Enrollment table. We use aliasing the snake-case the HMIS fields, so you can either use EnrollmentID or enrollment_id (snake-case is preferred). This ID is a String (32 char max) that is defined by the HMIS system that generated the data. For the OP HMIS, we use uuids. Other HMIS's use other conventions. This value is NOT unique in the Enrollment Table, but it _should_ be unique in combination with the `data_source_id`.
  * The above comments apply to ProjectID, PersonalID, OrganizationID, and HouseholdID.

#### What's the difference between `GrdaWarehouse::Hud::Enrollment` and `Hmis::Hud::Enrollment` models?

Both models are backed by the same table. We have separate model classes for the Warehouse and HMIS to encapsulate different logic. Shared logic is present in concerns (`app/models/concerns/hud_concerns`).

#### What's the difference between the `User` and `users` tables? Whats the `UserID` column all about?

| Database | Table name | Warehouse Model | HMIS Model | Usage |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |------- |
| `app` | `users` | `User`     | `Hmis::User` | This is the rails application user. Each record represents a user that can log into the application. These users have access controls, audit histories, and so on.
| `warehouse` | `User`  | `GrdaWarehouse::Hud::User`    | `Hmis::Hud::User` | These records are imported from external HMIS data sources, or generated from the OP HMIS. Imported records oftentimes do NOT correspond to any "real" application user. Table structure comes from `User.csv` specification. The `UserID` column from this table is present on all the other CSV-structured tables. In HUD's words, "UserID in this file is used to associate data in other CSV files with a specific user."

# How to Create a New Report

Follow these steps to create a new custom report.

1. Generate scaffolding for a new [Rails Driver](https://github.com/degica/rails_drivers):
    ```bash
    rails g driver custom_new_report_name
    ```
2. Add the relevant routes, controller, and view to the new Driver. See other examples for how they should be namespaced.
3. Add your new report to the `report_list` in the `GrdaWarehouse::WarehouseReports::ReportDefinition` model. Make sure to wrap it in a check to see whether the driver is loaded. See [ReportDefinition](https://github.com/greenriver/hmis-warehouse/blob/production/app/models/grda_warehouse/warehouse_reports/report_definition.rb) for examples.
4. Finally, run `rails db:seed` to populate the database with your new report definition. Alternatively, you can run the two relevant steps individually:
    ```ruby
    # Generates a new ReportDefinition
    GrdaWarehouse::WarehouseReports::ReportDefinition.maintain_report_definitions
    # Adds the report to the "all reports" group
    AccessGroup.maintain_system_groups
    ```
