# Boston HMIS Warehouse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/greenriver/hmis-warehouse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/greenriver/hmis-warehouse)

## Introduction
The HMIS Warehouse project was initiated by the City of Boston's Department of Neighborhood Development to gather data from across various HMIS installations, produce aggregated reports, and supply de-duplicated client information to the [Boston CAS](https://github.com/greenriver/boston-cas) system for Coordinated Access to housing.

The Warehouse is capable if ingesting standard HUD HMIS CSV files as well as data via the Social Solutions ETO API.

## Vision

The City of Boston made a conscientious choice to release this project into the open source under a GPL. Our goal is to promote this opportunity, allowing Boston's investment to assist other municipalities and organizations, and realize the vision of a tool under continuous, collaborative improvement helping communities nationwide.

Looking ahead, we see the Warehouse codebase serving as a foundation for all communities that report to the department of Housing and Urban Development, or have a need to aggregate and de-duplicate homeless client data from across various systems.  To our knowledge, this is the only open source, freely available implementation of many HUD reports.

## Application Design

The application is designed around the [HUD Data Standards](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hmis/hmis-data-and-technical-standards/) and the data structure is based on the [HMIS Logical Model](http://www.hudhdx.info/VendorResources.aspx)

The application is written primarily in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) and we use [RVM](https://rvm.io/) to select a ruby version. Other ruby version managers should work fine, as would manually installing the ruby version mentioned in the `.ruby-version`

The application uses [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) for application data storage and [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/) or postgres for the warehouse data.

We've developed locally on OSX using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and deployed to Ubuntu 16.04 using `apt` for dependencies.

### Developer Prequisites

If you are unfamilar with contributing to open source projects on github you may first want to read some of the guides at:  https://guides.github.com/

There is a simple script to setup a development environment in `bin/setup`. To make it run smoothly you should have:

* A running Ruby 2.3+ environment with bundler 1.11+ installed.
* A local install of postgresql 9.4+ allowing your user to create new databases.

Once these are in place, `bin/setup` should:

* Install all ruby dependencies.
* Create initial copies of configuration files.
* Create an initial database and seed it with reference data and a randomly generated admin user.

If all goes well you should then be able to run `bin/rails server` and open the Warehouse in your system at http://localhost:3000 using the email/password created during `bin/setup`. If not, read `bin/setup` to figure out what went wrong and fix it.

Hack on your version as you see fit and if you have questions or want to contibute open an issue on github.

# Developer Notes

We use the following common rails gems and conventions:

* `haml` for view templating
* `bootstrap` for base styles and layout
* `sass` for custom-css
* `simple_form` for forms
* `kaminari` for pagination
* `brakeman` for basic security scanning.
* `rack-mini-profiler` to make sure pages are fast. Ideally <200ms
* helpers need to be explictly loaded in controllers. i.e. we have `config.action_controller.include_all_helpers = false` set
* `bin/rake generate controller ... ` doesn't make fixures and they are disabled in test_helper. We don't use them and instead seed data in test or let test create their own data however they need to.
* it also doesn't make helper or asset stubs, make them by hand if you need one. See `config/application.rb` for details.

# Multiple databases

The project reads/writes from several different databases. We keep track of these different environments by setting up parallel db configs/structures for each non-default database. For example, health care data is configured in config/database_bhchp.yml, and database resources are in db_bhchp. Most things should just work as expected without doing anything special, but there is on exception. When running migrations, we need to use a custom generator, since the default rails one hardcodes the migration output path. So instead of

```
rails generate migration foo
```

you'll need to run

```
rails generate bhchp_migration foo
```

if you want to migrate something in the health care database.

Lastly, all of the expected rake tasks for database manipulation are there, but prefaced with the 'bhchp' namespace. So, for instance

```
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

becomes

```
bundle exec rake bhchp:db:migrate
```
