## Inactive Client Report

This driver provides a report for tracking down clients who are still enrolled but no longer active at the project, or in the homeless side of HMIS.  This was originally built for Boston CoC with the following scope:

- Universe: Everyone enrolled in a chosen set of project (use standard project picker to determine enrollment universe, default to Coordinated Entry.)
- Definition of inactive (within the chosen amount of time - default 90 days):
  * No bed night in an Emergency Shelter
  * No interaction with Street Outreach
  * No Current Living Situation or Assessment collected in Coordinated Entry
