# TODO: Calling this a Report is a misnomer now. Its really a bunch of calculators/classifiers
# and some metadata for each.
# When we next update this, we should move each measure and calculate_bh_cp* method to
# separate classes for better code readability and test-ability.
# There is some shared/reusable bits like continuously_enrolled_* and the
# various date_ranges that could be mixed or passed in to each.
# `#value_set_lookups` `#in_set?` and friends should move to the model in HL7:: namespace
# with the VALUE_SETS constant as a constructor for it, since "Value Sets" and "Code Systems"
# are useful concepts for all HL7-based medical coding.
