          Choose a contract start and end date, this report will find the first enrollment for each client overlapping the
          contract dates and return a list of clients, where each client only appears once. Clients will be ordered by their
          Entry Date.
        %p
          Note that if you want clients who are new in the current month, delete everyone with an open enrollment
          starting prior to the first of the month. In the initial month of the contract, you should include all clients
          with enrollments overlapping that month.
