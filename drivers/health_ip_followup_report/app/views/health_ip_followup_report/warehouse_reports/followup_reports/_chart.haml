        Count of the number of submittable QAs for Follow-up within 3 days of hospital discharge within a month.
      %dt Admissions
      %dd
        Count of the number of inpatient admissions per month as reported by ED/IP Visits.
        Visits are reported at admission, so, extended visits, or visits at the end of the
        month may appear on a different months than the corresponding QA.
        Because visit information may be delayed, the most recent data may be under reported.
