# Factory to resolve the user access loader for a given entity. It also resolves
# the entity that should be passed to the loader. A resolver blocker is used to
# traverse associations as, in the case of graphql, another data loader would be
# used to resolve the association.
#
# It's up to the caller to actually invoke the loader with the resolved entity to
# perform the access check.
#
# @example
#   factory = Hmis::EntityAccessLoaderFactory.new(user)
#   loader, entity = factory.perform(project) do |record, association|
#     # resolve an entity association. In graphql, a data loader would be used
#     association.send(record)
#   end
#   # resolve a user's permission on project through the loader. Loader.fetch() would
#   # be used to called for many projects
#   allowed = loader.fetch_one(entity, :can_do_something)
class Hmis::EntityAccessLoaderFactory
  # @param user [Hmis::User]

  # Given an entity, return a tuple of the loader and the entity to check against
  #
  # @param entity [#entity_record] active record entity
  # @yieldparam [#entity_record] record

  # @yieldreturn [#resolved, nil] the association (record.association)
  # @return [Array<Hmis::BaseLoader, #entity>]
