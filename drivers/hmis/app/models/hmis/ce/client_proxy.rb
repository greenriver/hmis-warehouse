# ClientProxy supports flexibility and deduplication of clients on CE referral waitlists.
# Hmis::Ce::Match::Candidate refers to this class instead of directly to a client record.
# - Proxy class allows more flexibility to point at other records (such as non-HMIS VSP clients)
# - Using destination client ensures clients are deduplicated on waitlists, even if they are duplicated in source client records.
# - Destination client also allows use of full client data to determine eligibility (e.g., open enrollments across deduplicated records).

  class ClientProxy < GrdaWarehouseBase
    # For now, this is the GrdaWarehouse::Hud::Client representing the *destination* client.
