# Decision Tree
# If the HouseholdID is blank, consider it an individual enrollment, ensure RelationshipToHoH is 1
# If the household only has one person, ensure RelationshipToHoH is 1
# If the household has more than one person, and there is a female 18 or older,
# set the oldest female to RelationshipToHoH = 1 and set any other RelationshipToHoH == 1 to 99
# If the household has more than one person, but no female 18 or older, and someone in the household is 18 or older, set the oldest person to RelationshipToHoH = 1 and set any other RelationshipToHoH == 1 to 99
# If everyone in the household is 17 or younger, and there is a person 10 or younger, set the oldest person to RelationshipToHoH = 1 and set any other RelationshipToHoH == 1 to 99
# If the household only contains clients between the age of 11 and 17 inclusive, break up the household and set everyone as RelationshipToHoH = 1
