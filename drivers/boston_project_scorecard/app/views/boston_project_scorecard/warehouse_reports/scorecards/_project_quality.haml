        HUD will review information in eLOCCS, APRs, CAS warehouse data, Core
        Demographics / racial equity dashboard data and information provided from the local HUD CPD field office;
        including monitoring reports and audit reports, and performance standards on prior grants, and will assess
        projects using the following criteria on a pass/fail basis:

      %td= f.input :initial_goals_pass, as: :pretty_boolean, label: false, **@report.field_input_options(:initial_goals_pass, current_user)
      %td= f.input :initial_goals_notes, as: :text, label: false, **@report.field_input_options(:initial_goals_notes, current_user)

      %td= f.input :independent_living_notes, as: :text, label: false, **@report.field_input_options(:independent_living_notes, current_user)
    %tr
      %td

        of inadequate financial accounting practices, indications of project mismanagement, a drastic reduction in the
        population served, made program changes without prior HUD approval, or has lost a project site.
        (Pass if the applicant has not had issues and no technical assistance was needed.)
      %td= f.input :management_oversight_pass, as: :pretty_boolean, label: false, **@report.field_input_options(:management_oversight_pass, current_user)
      %td= f.input :management_oversight_notes, as: :text, label: false, **@report.field_input_options(:management_oversight_notes, current_user)
