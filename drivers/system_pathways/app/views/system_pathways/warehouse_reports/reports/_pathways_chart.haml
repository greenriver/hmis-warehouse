%p The above chart tracks clients with open homeless enrollments in the selected universe.  System pathways are limited to those that proceed through the continuum.  If a client goes backwards within the continuum (from more housed to less housed) the regression is ignored for the puposes of this report unless they first exited to a permanent destination.  Clients who exited to a permanent destination and then subsequently enrolled in a homeless project are counted in the Returns to Homelessness category.  The progression of least to most housed is as follows:
%ul
  %li SO (4)
  %li ES (0, 1)
  %li SH (8)
  %li TH (2)
  %li PH - RRH (13)
  %li PH - PSH (3), PH - PH (9), PH - OPH (10)
