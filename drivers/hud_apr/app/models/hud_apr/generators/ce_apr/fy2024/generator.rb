    # NOTE: Questions 4 through 9
    # Depending on the HMIS implementation and how the CoC’s Coordinated Entry System is set up, CE data could be entered into a single project or scattered
    # across multiple projects in HMIS. Every HMIS project must have a response to data element 2.09 [Coordinated Entry Participation Status]; projects that operate
    # as a Coordinated Entry access point and/or receive referrals through Coordinated Entry processes will be included in the report. If data is collected for 4.19
    # [Coordinated Entry Assessment] and/or 4.20 [Coordinated Entry Event] but the project is indicated at data element 2.09 [Coordinated Entry Participation Status]
    # as not participating in Coordinated Entry as an access point or receiving referrals then the project must be excluded from the report universe.
    # The information to be reported on Coordinated Entry for the APR beginning October 1, 2023, is “system-wide." The system being reported on is the CoC where
    # the Supportive Services Only: Coordinated Entry (SSO: CE) project was funded.

    # Question 10
    # The universe of data for this question is expanded to include all CE activity during the report date range. This includes data in elements 4.19 (CE Assessment) and 4.20 (CE Event) regardless of project or enrollment in which the data was collected.

    # This selects just ids for the clients, to ensure uniqueness, but uses select instead of pluck
    # so that we can find in batches.
    # Find any clients that fit the filter criteria _and_ have at least one assessment in their enrollment
    # occurring within the report range
