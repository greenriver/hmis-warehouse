      = "Unit utilization percentages are based upon the unit capacities your agency reported for its individual programs in the most recent Point-in-Time Survey (Annual Homeless Census) conducted by #{Translation.translate('the Boston Emergency Shelter Commission')}. The aggregate number of household-nights over the entire reporting period, divided by the product of unit capacity and nights in the reporting period, gives the percentage utilization for each program for the reporting period. Also, counts of households for each individual program are computed for each night and displayed in the chart below."

      ="Unit capacity figures are taken from the numbers your agency reported during the last Annual Homeless Census. Please notify #{Translation.translate('Boston HMIS staff at DND')} if any program unit capacity numbers below are incorrect."

      The percent utilization rates reported are intended to identify programs which may or may not be using the HMIS correctly by failing to enter or exit households from the system. Very low utilization may indicate households missing from the HMIS, or clients missing household ids or with incomplete values in the relationship to head of household field, while very high utilization may indicate inactive households who have not been exited from the HMIS. This report, along with the Active Client Length of Stay Report, should be used to identify clients who may need to be entered into or exited from a program. All programs are expected to maintin unit utilization rates between 85% and 105%, as outlined in the Boston HMIS Data Standards and Improvement Plan.

      If an individual active head of household has unit register records in the HMIS associated with a current enrollment in a program, his or her length of stay will be calculated from unit register records; otherwise, the head of household's length of stay will be computed from his or her active program enrollment.

      The report uses your agency's client code to de-duplicate client records; periodically running a Duplicate Client report and merging duplicate records is recommended.
