      The report also computes the total number of records for each program and the number of clients in each program missing at least one Universal Data Element, producing a percentage of these clients missing one or more data elements as a proportion of the total number of clients served. The grade assigned to each program is based upon that percentage; please refer to the Grading System summary at the beginning of this report. Also, the numbers of clients missing data elements are summarized for the agency as a whole at the end of the Missing Values Summary table.
