= render 'breadcrumbs'

%p
  This page demonstrates how to include a javascript file for only one route, instead of globally.  This example includes d3 and uses it to count the divs on the page.
  You should see some text in the box below if it is working.

.well
  .output

%p
  This is accomplised by adding an array to the controller to indicate which files to include.  This controller specifies the following:
  %br
  %code @per_page_js = ['style_guide_example']
