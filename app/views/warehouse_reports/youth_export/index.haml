  The following clients were between the ages of #{@filter.start_age} and #{@filter.end_age} during the time frame #{@filter.start} to #{@filter.end}.  In addition, the client list is filtered down based on chosen Projects, Organizations, Data Sources, and Cohorts.  Where more than one answer is available, the most-recent answer attached to an enrollment that was open within the date range is used.  For example, if a client exited multiple enrollments that were open within the date range, Destination at exit (3.12) will be shown for the most-recent exit, even if the exit occurred after the date range.
