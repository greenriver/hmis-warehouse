    %p.w-100 Report will find any enrollment open at a project in a given CoC where there are zero or more than one Head of Household.  These are checked for enrollments in project types #{project_types_requiring_hoh.to_sentence}.  In addition, HUD does not allow re-use of HouseholdID for future re-enrollments, even for individual enrollments. Clients appearing once and in an individual enrollment with a Head of Houshold of self, have additional enrollments outside of the visible range with duplicate HouseholdIDs.
