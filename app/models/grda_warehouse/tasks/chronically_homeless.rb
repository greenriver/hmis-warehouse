# Figure out who is chronically homeless
# Our working definition of chronic homelessness is:
# 1. Currently Homeless in ES (1), SH (8) or SO (4) and not currently housed (other residential types)
# 2. Disabled
# 3. Homeless in 12 of the last 36 months.
#
# Official Definition:
#
# A ‘‘chronically homeless’’ individual is defined to mean a homeless individual with a disability who lives either in a place not meant for human habitation, a safe haven, or in an emergency shelter, or in an institutional care facility if the individual has been living in the facility for fewer than 90 days and had been living in a place not meant for human habitation, a safe haven, or in an emergency shelter immediately before entering the institutional care facility. In order to meet the ‘‘chronically homeless’’ definition, the individual also must have been living as described above continuously for at least 12 months, or on at least 4 separate occasions in the last 3 years, where the combined occasions total a length of time of at least 12 months. Each period separating the occasions must include at least 7 nights of living in a situation other than a place not meant for human habitation, in an emergency shelter, or in a safe haven.
#
# Some notes:
# 1. Anyone homeless in all of the last 12 months is chronic
# 2. If you are homeless 12 or more months in the last 36 months, you also need to have had at least three episodes, this means that if you were homeless for the last 10 months, had 2 months housed and then the prior 24 months were homeless, you are still not chronic.
# 3. Ignore anyone currently enrolled in a DMH project, we'll catch them in the DMH chronic calculator
#
# Something like this is very helpful for debugging:
