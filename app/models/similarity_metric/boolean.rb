module SimilarityMetric
  class Boolean < Multinomial
    DESCRIPTION = <<~EOS
            _{{{human_name}}}_ converts the true/false values in the boolean
            HUD field `{{{field}}}` into 0 for same and 1 for different.
      #{'      '}
            In case of a match, the resulting similarity score is multiplied by a factor which varies inversely
            with the frequency of the boolean value of the matched category in the population.
            This factor is defined as the ratio of the total population size to the size of the
            subpopulation expressing the given value of `{{{field}}}`.
            To prevent rare values from having an outsize effect, this factor is capped at
            {{{max_multiplier}}}.
