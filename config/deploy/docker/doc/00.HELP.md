# Help, containers aren't running or are pending forever

  Things are broken, and you're panicking. Here are some things to try

  Log into AWS..

    * click on the service with problems
    * check events
    * check tasks. If you see none, try filtering to stopped tasks.

  ssh to EC2 instances and

    * sudo systemctl restart ecs

    * docker container ls, and docker stop problematic containers. We have a long
     stop time policy, and stuck containers, even of an unrelated type can cause
     problems.

    * run the update_agents.rb script from your laptop

    * check min and max healthly task definition parameters. ECS can get
      confused and deadlocked if they make for an impossible deployment

    * sudo systemctl start docker

    * sudo systemctl restart docker

    * reboot cluster server


# Can't build

    * If you get errors like: failed to export image: failed to create image: failed to get layer sha256:d4f636367bc5324f78075f817666c33561a97bc61328b08caddfa7957f2352df: layer does not exist
      try adding `RUN true` lines around the problematic Dockerfile line.

# Want to make cluster smaller?

  * Modify one of the auto-scaling groups
  * The instances are protected from scale-in, so you can safely set the target
    size.
  * That said, for making them smaller, set the desired and minimum to what you
    want, and keep the max at the old bigger value.
  * Drain the instance you want to remove.
  * When down to zero containers, terminate the EC2 instance.
  * Update the auto-scaling group to have the smaller maximum after that.
