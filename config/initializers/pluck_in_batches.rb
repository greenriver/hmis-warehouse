# Rails.logger.debug "Running initializer in #{__FILE__}"

# This assumes you are in Rails 4 and you can pluck multiple columns

class ActiveRecord::Relation
  # pluck_in_batches:  yields an array of *columns that is at least size
  #                    batch_size to a block.
  #
  #                    Special case: if there is only one column selected than each batch
  #                                  will yield an array of columns like [:column, :column, ...]
  #                                  rather than [[:column], [:column], ...]
  # Arguments
  #   columns      ->  an arbitrary selection of columns found on the table.
  #   batch_size   ->  How many items to pluck at a time
  #   &block       ->  A block that processes an array of returned columns.
  #                    Array is, at most, size batch_size
  #
  # Returns
  #   nothing is returned from the function
